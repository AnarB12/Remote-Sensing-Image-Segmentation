# Remote Sensing Image Segmentation

## Overview

This repository contains a version of code used for my **master's thesis** on satellite image segmentation. The primary focus of this project is on segmenting remote sensing images using the U-Net architectures. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This is currently a simple application, but it will be updated and extended over time.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
- **Model Training:** 
- **Evaluation:**
- **Visualization:**
